## Task 1: Conceptual Questions

#### 1. If your working directory is myfolder/homework/, what relative path would you specify to get the file located at myfolder/MyData.csv?

-   /MyData.csv

#### 2. What are the major benefits of using R Projects?  

-   Reproducible, self-contained working directories with stable relative paths.

-   RStudio auto-sets the working directory when the project opens; keeps data, code, and outputs organized.

-   It integrates smoothly with git/GitHub.

#### 3. What is git and what is GitHub?  

-   git: a distributed version control system for tracking changes, branching, and merging.

-   GitHub: a cloud service that hosts git repositories and adds collaboration tools.

#### 4. What are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?  

-    (i) Tibbles print compactly (few rows/columns) and avoid automatic type conversion.

-   \(ii\) Tibbles are stricter: no partial name matching with \$, and subsetting keeps a tibble.

#### 5. Rewrite the following \*\*nested\*\* function call using Base R's chaining operator (\`\|\>\`):

```{r}
# Load packages used below
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

as_tibble(iris) |>
  select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) |>
  filter(Petal.Length < 1.55) |>
  arrange(Species)
```
